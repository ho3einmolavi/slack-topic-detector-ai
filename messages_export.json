Wanted to share some insights and thoughts before our meeting on Tuesday.\n\n*Quick Update*: The SM free pages are looking good for completion this week. But, with the extended scope and additional features for the Pro version and Julien's design updates, I've been looking into the best approach for our launch plan.\n\nWe’re looking at a couple of strategies to ensure we’re aligning with both our quality standards and your expectations. Here are the options we came up with:\n\n1. *Full Launch in April*: This option would allow us to include all flows, pages, and design updates in the launch, ensuring a comprehensive presentation of both the free and Pro versions. In this approach we will hand over, both SM free and pro by the end of March, on staging for your review. Then we will have 10 to 14 days to implement any possible feedback from your side and also prepare for launch early/mid-April.\n2. *Two-Phased Launch*: In this approach, we will divide the scope into 2 phases:\n    ◦ *First Phase in Mid-March*: We go live with the new branding for the free version (I’m referring to the logo, color and font changes) and introduce a redesigned homepage hero section. This phase would exclude the user with an expired subscription flows, Onboarding guide, and Deals pages, and the majority of the new design changes Julien proposed.\n    ◦ *Second Phase*: Following the initial launch, we would focus on updating the remainder of the free pages based on the new proposed design and completing the tasks excluded in the first phase. This approach ensures that we can still meet an earlier timeline for part of the project, while providing additional time to perfect the remaining elements by mid-April.\nPlease review the options so we can discuss them in detail on Tuesday to land on what works best for you and the project's success.\nYour thoughts before our call would be very helpful, or if there's anything specific you want to dive into, just let me know.",

So adjusting our contract to 125 hours in March or so perhaps?\n\nGenerally, we’d like to do a full launch all at once for several reasons.\n\nAnd we’d prefer it sooner rather than later.\n\nWe also want to make sure we have enough time for possible debugging and slight adjustments for the live website if there are obvious and relatively straight forward improvements to make. That’s why we added additionally 15-20 hours compared to the estimated needed for the March rollout initially.\n\nAlso, in terms of design changes, what’s the rough status there? What elements or pages still need to be adjusted to the Enhanced version? I’m asking because many of the smaller elements I think could be tweaked after launch, especially things like accent colors and elements, as long as the color scheme, navigation, and enhanced home page are all done. So other pages, just with adjusted color scheme and new navbar might be enough to go live.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance here where we don’t want to go live with an incomplete website but we also don’t expect it to be perfect, that’s why we did the 100 + 40 + 40 + 40 for the next months :smile: We think we will make smaller, less vital adjustments in this period.",

We'll get these sorted while you're checking out the rest of the site:\n\n• Checkout\n• Courses\n• Email preference center\n• Onboarding - user guide\n• Brain Teaser page\nPlease let me know what you think.

Over the past two days, as we tested all forms, we temporarily disabled it to prevent reaching submission limitations.\nCurrently, it's active on all main forms, including SM, PoM, Tactics, and the Pro landing page forms. The rate limit is set to block a user after three attempts, meaning if a user submits a form three times, they won't be able to submit a fourth for the next seven days.\nWe want to ensure you understand how this functionality could affect form submissions and welcome any suggestions you might have to tailor it to your needs. There's a tradeoff between increasing the number of attempts allowed and potentially inviting spam submissions. Additionally, it's important to note that we have Google reCAPTCHA enabled on all forms for added security.",

Here is what I propose:\nWe can start working on:\n• Learning Hub widget for \"Latest Tactics\"\n• Update navigation on learning hub\n• Update user guide on learning hub\n• Update general layout for learning hub (making it lighter on the user's brain)\nAnd in parallel, we can also start a discovery task for one the following items:\n• Job Board (good integration with social profile would be nice)\n• Feed-based social profile / interaction module\n• Add gamification so users gain points for certain actions\nUpon your approval on the estimates after the discovery, you and <@U46P0EG4A> can start a contract expansion discussion if necessary.\n\nLet me know what you think about this approach. We can definitely talk about an expansion now if you think it works better.\n\nCC: <@U05R8DF8EJE>",

Here’s how it works (if feasible)\n\nClick on CTA  > Stripe Checkout page > Enter name, email and payment info > Land in SM Pro Hub (homepage) as logged in user and start onboarding\n• This is only possible if we can use the *name & e-mail* fields from Stripe to create a member in MP and start a subscription for that member. (needs verification)\nMeanwhile we send user a confirmation e-mail that allows\n1. Go to account page to set password and username (do we _really_ need a username, since unique identifier is e-mail) \n2. Land on Hub without entering password (like magic link of Slack)",

Current checkout pages (both <https://www.stackedmarketer.com/sm-pro-7-trial-for-7-days/|normal> and <https://www.stackedmarketer.com/register/extra-14-day-trail-19/|extended>) are also *account creation* pages, where users are asked to enter _*username*_ and _*password*_ in addition to standart checkout data (e-mail, address and payment detail).\n    a. I am not sure Stripe checkout supports these fields, will check\n    b. Even if it supports and shares it with Memberpress to create new users, is it safe to share password with Stripe ? ",

DECISION: If you approve I would ilke to implement the <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjUALvnpCU&amp;ab_channel=GoogleMapsPlatform|address autofill> in our own flow, because this would make serious improvement on UX.\n2. You said in the response video “we need business checkbox for all, not just EU members”. \n    a.

I feel like everything else depends on the Gutenberg refactoring, makes little sense to implement a full website redesign on Elementor to switch to Gutenberg a month later",

At the moment, all design tasks have been temporarily paused due to the ongoing branding retouch project. To maximize our productivity this month, we're evaluating whether it's practical to start refactoring the Homepage with Gutenberg or if it would result in extensive rework due to the ongoing rebranding efforts.\n\nThe AutoPub updates are in progress, and as previously mentioned, we anticipate delivering them to you next week.\n\nIf you have any other requests that are independent of the rebranding process, please don't hesitate to share them with us.\n\nDue to the current task dependencies, it seems unlikely that we'll be able to fully utilize the allocated 150 hours for September. Therefore, we're considering transferring the remaining hours to future months. Does it work for you?",

This caching also caused issues with logging into SM Pro, seeing reports with an active subscription (some people would see the paywall even though they had an active subscription). Clearing the cache on Cloudflare and *Breeze (within the WP dashboard)* seems to solve it for new visitors but it’s still not perfect. So, caching behavior is not creating a good user experience at the moment. \n• Forum notifications - Even though I have subscriptions for all topics and posts activated, I never get an email notification about them. It seems there’s some ‘connection’ missing, even though I get all other WordPress email notifications such as course comments.",

        "text": "hey <@U059AC59LLF> quick question\n\nOur dev team questions the \"Content Type\" & \"*Business Model*\" & \"*Topic*\" selectors on the Full Archive page, since the options under all are actually subcategories of the 'Pro' category. Their concern is\n\n\"Using one taxonomy for three selectors creates complexity. Imagine that the client creates a new category. How can we decide which selectors should show it?\"\n\nNow, there are two options in my head as a solution to this question:\n1. Leave it as it is, if you add another subcategory in the future as a Content Type, Business Model or Topic, then there's a maintenance need to put that under the related dropdown within Archive page.\n2. Let's create a new taxonomy structure where Pro category has 3 sub categories within which the related tags are organized. (This approach might need a migration but will futureproof tag structure and Archive dropdowns)\n    a. Content Type \n        i. Report\n        ii. Article\n    b. Business Model\n        i. E-commerce\n        ii. SaaS...\n    c. Topic\n        i. Copywriting\n        ii. Paid Social...",

Disabling it was the quickest way to get things working again. We do recommend turning it back on once the conflict is sorted out, since it helps with site performance.\n\nThere are two ways we can move forward:\n1. *Tweak Perfmatters settings*: Instead of delaying all JavaScript, we can be more selective about which files to delay. It’s a more reliable long-term fix, but would take around 4–6 hours of dev and testing to make sure everything works smoothly.\n2. *Stick with the current setup*: We keep delaying all JS and try to find the specific file(s) causing the issue to exclude them. It’s faster, but there’s a higher chance of running into similar problems later.\nSince we're currently out of retainer hours, I wanted to check in and see if resolving this is something you’d like to prioritize this quarter.\n\nCC: <@UL2E9PUQP> <@U05UN1BUVCK>",

It would be  good to take feedback from you at this level before moving more hi-fi design investment. <@U059AC59LLF>\n\nMain rationale is having pop-up with 3 screens, one for each question.\n\nFirst one has a welcome copy &amp; value proposition of onboarding.\n\nEach has a question copy and single/multi selection hint.\n\nThe multi-select (topic/business model) options might have some visual cues (icons or little images) that resemble the option.\n\nExpertise level options has a different design to both discern the single select nature and add some explanatory text (like, little definitions of expertise levels) to make an informed selection.",

For the first tier they have different prices from $30 to $250 per month.\nin the case that client wants to choose amongst theses non-free tools then we can give them a more detailed comparison.\n\n*Free solutions:*\nwe have 3 options in this category:\n1. *Simple Tour Guide WordPress plugin*: this is a useful tool for someone who wants to creates tours without any need to customization in dialog position, dialog events and etc.\n2. *a11y-dialog*: as it describes it self, it is just a dialog window which follows w3 consortium’s modal pattern. it does not have any special features/methods which been developed for user onboarding\n3. *introjs*: Due to its feature set, handy API, and rich documentation, Intro.js offers a wide range of customization options for creating guided tours, allowing developers to precisely handle the user experience. Its features include step-by-step guidance, highlighting specific elements, and easy integration into web pages. It maintains a good balance between being feature-rich while remaining relatively easy to implement. It’s also worth mentioning that using Intro.js for commercial purposes requires a license, with its lifetime license costing $10.\nOur suggestion is using *<https://introjs.com/|introjs> ,* but we wanted your approval before moving fwd.\n\nNote: UserGuide flow  design will be created after SM Pro Homepage is finished.",

This allows us to retain information about the offered content even if the visitor doesn't make a purchase during their initial visit. In subsequent visits to StackedMarketer, we can still identify the specific offered content for which they are considering a subscription.\n\nDev Question is:\n• Currently, in the initial code, I have set the expiration time for the cookie to be 1 day.\nWhat would be the appropriate expiration time for the cookie in terms of hours or days?\n\nMy answer was:\n• I believe this should not expire unless: the user comes back to subscription via a pro content PAYWALL. \n    ◦ If the user comes to payment to unlock a content (ie, paywall), then we should update the 'offered_content' as the paywalled content. \n    ◦ If not, it should remain as it is and not expire.\nCan you confirm my solution, or propose another one appropriate for your customers?",

Updated Tags\n\nTag Name: UTM Decorator v2:\n - there was errors with previous version of this tag which caused in some cases it return refferer as NULL and let some utm parameters not set properly and constantly some events not fire on time. we have fixed that issue. (we didn’t change the logic of the code, just some bug fixing)\n• also added our gravity form fields population to it (it was previously with elementor)\nTag Name: HTML - Form Submission Listener :\n• this tag fires fm_Form_Submission event upon submission in gravity forms. it not change previous data layer variables of fm_what and fm_email ",

There are some updates and questions that have arisen as follows:\n\n*Updates*\nIn our JavaScript file on the frontend, we have exactly implemented the same logic that exists in the following three tags:\n• HTML: Storing Referrer into Session Storage\n• HTML: Storing UTMs into Session Storage\n• UTM Decorator v2\nSo, we save the referrer and UTMs in session storage (considering all aspects of how the referrer value affects the utm_source, etc.).\nThen, we populate the hidden form fields (similar to the current production site), and we submit those field values to CM.\nTherefore, in the new site, we will not need those three tags created in GTM, and those tags can be removed after launching the new site on production.\n\n*Questions*\nWe were checking the production site to ensure in which forms UTMs and referrer should be set. In the current production site, for Free newsletter forms (SM, PoM, Tactics), both UTMs and referrer are sent to CM. On the pro landing page, there are four forms in which only UTMs are sent to CM, but not the referrer.\n*_Question 1_:* I wanted to confirm whether the referrer in the pro landing page forms was missed intentionally or if we should send its data to CM.\n_*Question 2*_: Another question regarding the production's checkout form. In the production's checkout form, at the moment, you are only sending the entered username to the custom field (Forum_Username) in CM. No UTMs/referrer are sent. Is this okay, or should we consider sending UTMs fields in this form to CM?\n\nNow that GTM has been activated, we need to crawl through the different parts of the site to identify any cases where triggers are not firing properly. In certain instances, it may be necessary to create a new tag. It's important to note that prior to launching the new site, we won't be modifying any existing elements. Our current access permissions do not allow us to make any modifications, but we're grateful for any assistance in this matter.",

We've took the time to realign internally and see how we could best tackle the branding plan while limiting the amount of hours we spend on it as branding can quickly become time-consuming.\nGiven that we're not reworking anything in depth but need to align the 4 identities, *I evaluate that for the branding an initial estimate to rework the whole system would take about 24 to 30hrs.*\n\nThe deliverables for that would be basically as discussed:\n&gt; Updated and improved logos.\n&gt; New modular and flexible visual identity (including color palette, visual art direction, typography, etc)\nFor further deliverables like social media templates, PPTs, etc I think we can account for another 12 to 20h but we can discuss those to see where your priorities lies.\n\nThis does not include any design work for the websites themselves.\nHopefully, aside from the style guides and components, we won't have too much rework.\n\nI would probably want to spread that work over 2 sprints to give us room for other projects. Maybe a 3rd sprint for the last deliverable that are not pertaining to the website.\n\n*For details:*\n• *Logo explorations and alignment: 8h*\n• *Core branding and VI Component design: 10h*\n• *Alignment and exploration to ensure consistency: 4h*\n• *Expanded Art Direction: 4h*\n*Let me know if you have any questions*\n\n*CC <@U46P0EG4A>* *<@U039WK9NWA0>* ",

When that was removed, or when we reuploaded the image, it worked.\n\nSo there might be some hidden formatting we’re not aware of. I couldn’t find anything in the HTML source from the preview though.\n\nSecond, regarding WordPress categories, there are TWO cases in which we don’t want to select the News category.\n• For The Crew’s Insights, the News category shouldn’t be assigned.\n• For Psychology of Marketing, the News category shouldn’t be assigned.\nLet me know the feedback and rough timeline for this when you can.\n\nThanks!",

It seems to be hard-coded to have headline + image, otherwise, adding an image after a paragraph breaks things.\n\nMy comment when requesting this was _“Is the structure of a section hard-coded that the image must be *only* after a heading? If so, we’d like to have the ability to include more than one heading or image with in a ##Section”_ and I now noticed in the sample doc that there’s only headline + image.\n\nThis is the doc which we used and breaks when we do paragraph + image + paragraph: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pBQ_IS5MYKU6_yZ9Cmjai-1JDWINMJ-r_9fQbx4Ndwg/edit?usp=sharing>\n\nCould you please work on an update as soon as possible so we can use AutoPub with the other templates?

This was the first time with the newest AutoPub version.\n\nWe’ve kept the CM drafts for reference here:\n\n<https://cm.stackedmarketer.com/campaigns/13ba645044be2fe22540ef23f30feded/create>\n\n<https://cm.stackedmarketer.com/campaigns/e13240bc708a6e272540ef23f30feded/create>\n\nThe doc that was used is this one: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/12g_-2HuFT9KvJtRgJujez5pk4KnOEQroFMnhZPgm31I/edit?usp=sharing>\n\nIs there some caching that doesn’t update the images that get pulled or?\n\n*Features:*\n\n1. Ability to push a draft without the sponsor logo in the heading (Especially relevant for SM Pro and Tactics templates but we should have this ability on all templates)\n2. Publishing PoM to WordPress, as one post. Title would be the subject line, then all sections would be pushed into that single post (FROM THE CREW, SPONSORED BY, PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT, and CLICKWORTHY).\nThe bug is the more important one to fix, of course, because it seems to happen once in a while in an unpredictable manner.",

Here are my topics for discussion:\n\n• Learning Hub is constantly expanding, which makes navigation harder. We already have sections for Latest Reports, you want to add the Latest Articles (Tactics) which makes sense. I would propose to \n    ◦ Make \"*Featured Content*\" section smaller, maybe removing the row under the line to make it lighter on brain\n    ◦ Find a way not to duplicate the latest contents on \"*Featured Content*\" section\n• We have separated \"*Courses You Might Like*\" (top most, right after Reports) and \"*Articles You Might Like*\" (lower most) sections which breaks the onboarding flow. It might be better to put personalized contents in proximity (maybe under a group) for users to make sense of them.\n• We need to refine the Dashboard Navigation (sub-menu) based on latest decisions.\n",

The issue is related to images with the same name, which can lead to the system using a previously saved image rather than the intended one.\nThe two images in question are as follows:\n1. Image on Campaign Monitor:\n    ◦ Name: test-2.png\n    ◦ URL: <https://i4.createsend1.com/ei/j/61/D7A/FCB/193625/csimport/test-2_3.png>\n2. Image on WordPress:\n    ◦ Name: test-2.png\n    ◦ URL: <https://www.stackedmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/test-2.png>\nTo fix this issue and ensure that the correct images are displayed on Campaign Monitor, we will implement a solution that generates a unique name for every single image. This will prevent naming conflicts and ensure that the intended images are always displayed.\nI think we should have this sorted out by tomorrow evening, myself or <@U039WK9NWA0>  will update  and send you the new template as soon as its fixed",

The plugin codes are a mess! We are actively working on it and we're aiming to have everything smoothed out by tomorrow.\n3. *Email Template Refinement:* We're currently exploring different approaches to address the remaining issues with the email templates. The new WP template is already integrated into AutoPub, and once we finalize the email template adjustments, we'll complete the AutoPub update.\n4. *Old Articles issue:* Good news! We've discovered an automated solution to address the duplicated image and extra tag issues within the \"News\" category. If all goes according to plan, we expect to have these matters resolved by the end of today.\nRegarding your request for staging to mirror production content for video creation; Despite the challenges we're facing with the course pages, we're committed to having everything ready for you on staging by the end of tomorrow.

An example is :\n    ◦ When a user changes e-mail, the mail preference token created by Memberpress stays the same which causes problems on e-mails. \nRESULT: We suggest to make the e-mail field of the profile page NON EDITABLE. If an edge case happens where a user really needs to change their e-mail, they should just get in touch with support.\n\nHo does it sound?",

So, the full URL would look like this: <https://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=memberpress-trans&amp;subscription=123&amp;include-confirmations=true>. This will display the hidden transaction, so it can be edited.\n\nI hope this helps.\nKind regards,",
