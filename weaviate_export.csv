1707743013.318609,Parnia,Stackedmarketer Website Launch Strategy and Phases,"Hi <@U059AC59LLF>
I hope you had a relaxing weekend. :relaxed:

I’ve been deep-diving into the best path forward for the website launch, especially given the recent scope changes. Wanted to share some insights and thoughts before our meeting on Tuesday.

*Quick Update*: The SM free pages are looking good for completion this week. But, with the extended scope and additional features for the Pro version and Julien's design updates, I've been looking into the best approach for our launch plan.

We’re looking at a couple of strategies to ensure we’re aligning with both our quality standards and your expectations. Here are the options we came up with:

1. *Full Launch in April*: This option would allow us to include all flows, pages, and design updates in the launch, ensuring a comprehensive presentation of both the free and Pro versions. In this approach we will hand over, both SM free and pro by the end of March, on staging for your review. Then we will have 10 to 14 days to implement any possible feedback from your side and also prepare for launch early/mid-April.
2. *Two-Phased Launch*: In this approach, we will divide the scope into 2 phases:
    ◦ *First Phase in Mid-March*: We go live with the new branding for the free version (I’m referring to the logo, color and font changes) and introduce a redesigned homepage hero section. This phase would exclude the user with an expired subscription flows, Onboarding guide, and Deals pages, and the majority of the new design changes Julien proposed.
    ◦ *Second Phase*: Following the initial launch, we would focus on updating the remainder of the free pages based on the new proposed design and completing the tasks excluded in the first phase. This approach ensures that we can still meet an earlier timeline for part of the project, while providing additional time to perfect the remaining elements by mid-April.
Please review the options so we can discuss them in detail on Tuesday to land on what works best for you and the project's success.
Your thoughts before our call would be very helpful, or if there's anything specific you want to dive into, just let me know.",refact-stackedmarketer,,"Discussion on the strategy and phased approach for the Stackedmarketer website launch, including options for full launch in April or a two-phased launch starting in mid-March.",4ac5b965-c57f-427f-8a84-2f4e19f836ad,U039WK9NWA0,2025-12-11T21:21:53.939Z

1708623935.583919,Abdurrahman,Course Progress Segmentation Strategy in Campaign Monitor,"hey <@U059AC59LLF>  can you please comment the following question below?

While we have the data of course progress in CM, we can create segments according to these criteria:
• Collect users who have not enrolled in any course/courses.
• Collect users who have enrolled in course/courses but have not made any progress (0% progress).
• Collect users who have completed course/courses (100% progress).
In other words, the segments we create can filter based on non-enrollment, started courses (0% progress), completed courses (100% progress), *but we cannot filter based on progress value (for example, filtering users who have less than 50% progress in a course).*

1707747735.405849,Manu,Stackedmarketer Website Launch Strategy and Phases,"Hi <@U039WK9NWA0>, thanks. Hope you’re having a good start to the week! Would it help to add more hours in March? So adjusting our contract to 125 hours in March or so perhaps?

Generally, we’d like to do a full launch all at once for several reasons.

And we’d prefer it sooner rather than later.

We also want to make sure we have enough time for possible debugging and slight adjustments for the live website if there are obvious and relatively straight forward improvements to make. That’s why we added additionally 15-20 hours compared to the estimated needed for the March rollout initially.

Also, in terms of design changes, what’s the rough status there? What elements or pages still need to be adjusted to the Enhanced version? I’m asking because many of the smaller elements I think could be tweaked after launch, especially things like accent colors and elements, as long as the color scheme, navigation, and enhanced home page are all done. So other pages, just with adjusted color scheme and new navbar might be enough to go live.

It’s a tricky balance here where we don’t want to go live with an incomplete website but we also don’t expect it to be perfect, that’s why we did the 100 + 40 + 40 + 40 for the next months :smile: We think we will make smaller, less vital adjustments in this period.",refact-stackedmarketer,,"Discussion on the strategy and phased approach for the Stackedmarketer website launch, including options for full launch in April or a two-phased launch starting in mid-March.",4ac5b965-c57f-427f-8a84-2f4e19f836ad,U059AC59LLF,2025-12-11T21:22:03.627Z

1705933530.178059,Abdurrahman,Conversion Deeplink - Cookie Expiration Policy,"Hey <@U059AC59LLF> another question on Coversion Deeplink

When a visitor clicks a CTA on an external website and lands on StackedMarketer, we store the 'offered_content' data using a cookie. This allows us to retain information about the offered content even if the visitor doesn't make a purchase during their initial visit. In subsequent visits to StackedMarketer, we can still identify the specific offered content for which they are considering a subscription.

Dev Question is:
• Currently, in the initial code, I have set the expiration time for the cookie to be 1 day.
What would be the appropriate expiration time for the cookie in terms of hours or days?

My answer was:
• I believe this should not expire unless: the user comes back to subscription via a pro content PAYWALL. 
    ◦ If the user comes to payment to unlock a content (ie, paywall), then we should update the 'offered_content' as the paywalled content. 
    ◦ If not, it should remain as it is and not expire.
Can you confirm my solution, or propose another one appropriate for your customers?",refact-stackedmarketer,1705933530.178059,Discussion on the appropriate expiration time for cookies used in Conversion Deeplink to track offered content.

• Fix or replace BBPress with a (better) alternative
    ◦ BBPress seems to not be very active on the updates front
    ◦ I’ve explained some of the things we’d want to prioritize in this alternative, but happy to clarify more when you have questions
• Email preference center
    ◦ Option for people to change email, or unsub and resub to any of our newsletters.
    ◦ Less about design, especially since key functionality will be about API calls to Campaign Monitor
• Import old Psychology of Marketing articles to WordPress
    ◦ we have the HTML export and they are still live, so the goal here is to add them all under one Psychology of Marketing category until further redesign will be applied.
• Email polls
    ◦ Similar to the beehiiv polls functionality, if possible, are you familiar with it?
• SM Pro subscribers email integration and segmentation
    ◦ Right now, we have those who submit their email for the trial get sent into CM
    ◦ If they successfully pay, they get tagged as ACTIVE using Zapier
    ◦ If their subscription expires, they get tagged as CANCELED using Zapier
    ◦ Is there a better, more direct way to integrate this through MemberPress?

1694607851.275979,Parnia,Gutenberg Refactoring and Rebranding - Task and Hour Management,"Hi <@U059AC59LLF>,

I wanted to provide you with a quick update on our current status. At the moment, all design tasks have been temporarily paused due to the ongoing branding retouch project. To maximize our productivity this month, we're evaluating whether it's practical to start refactoring the Homepage with Gutenberg or if it would result in extensive rework due to the ongoing rebranding efforts.

The AutoPub updates are in progress, and as previously mentioned, we anticipate delivering them to you next week.

1705504721.301639,Manu,AutoPub - Image Uploading Error with New Version,"Hi <@U039WK9NWA0>,

We have an update request for AutoPub.

First one, there seems to be a bug with images sometimes, we’re not sure why but you can see the doc and the preview it generated for us here:

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0fSNBfEf8VovqnA5ufxOAgZwonKysAesTef4lEMxkw/edit?usp=sharing>

<https://www.stackedmarketer.com/wp-content/plugins/workflow-automation//cm-templates/sm-manu-glitch-test.html>

What we found is that the SPONSORED BY INSENSE image caused it. When that was removed, or when we reuploaded the image, it worked.

So there might be some hidden formatting we’re not aware of. I couldn’t find anything in the HTML source from the preview though.

Second, regarding WordPress categories, there are TWO cases in which we don’t want to select the News category.
• For The Crew’s Insights, the News category shouldn’t be assigned.
• For Psychology of Marketing, the News category shouldn’t be assigned.
Let me know the feedback and rough timeline for this when you can.

1695672722.320689,Julien Tricheux,Branding Plan and Visual Identity Alignment,"Hi <@U059AC59LLF>

Thank you for your patience. We've took the time to realign internally and see how we could best tackle the branding plan while limiting the amount of hours we spend on it as branding can quickly become time-consuming.
Given that we're not reworking anything in depth but need to align the 4 identities, *I evaluate that for the branding an initial estimate to rework the whole system would take about 24 to 30hrs.*

The deliverables for that would be basically as discussed:
&gt; Updated and improved logos.
&gt; New modular and flexible visual identity (including color palette, visual art direction, typography, etc)
For further deliverables like social media templates, PPTs, etc I think we can account for another 12 to 20h but we can discuss those to see where your priorities lies.

This does not include any design work for the websites themselves.
Hopefully, aside from the style guides and components, we won't have too much rework.

I would probably want to spread that work over 2 sprints to give us room for other projects. Maybe a 3rd sprint for the last deliverable that are not pertaining to the website.

*For details:*
• *Logo explorations and alignment: 8h*
• *Core branding and VI Component design: 10h*
• *Alignment and exploration to ensure consistency: 4h*
• *Expanded Art Direction: 4h*
*Let me know if you have any questions*

2. You said in the response video “we need business checkbox for all, not just EU members”.

To ensure smooth integration of previous events with the new site, we have updated some of the Tags and Triggers (in Preview mode), which I can explain briefly:


1.Updated Triggers

Trigger Name: Pageview - SM Pro Pages
• updated the regex value from smpro to sm-pro-signup
Trigger Name: Exclude Tactics Signup Page
• excluded PoM and Tactics (Previously, it was excluding only tactics)
Trigger Name: Event - SM Pro 7$ Try Form Submission
• in the second row of configuration, replaced smpro with sm-pro-signup

2. Updated Tags

Tag Name: UTM Decorator v2:
 - there was errors with previous version of this tag which caused in some cases it return refferer as NULL and let some utm parameters not set properly and constantly some events not fire on time. we have fixed that issue. (we didn’t change the logic of the code, just some bug fixing)

I would like to discuss the structure and navigation of Learning Hub with you. Here are my topics for discussion:

• Learning Hub is constantly expanding, which makes navigation harder. We already have sections for Latest Reports, you want to add the Latest Articles (Tactics) which makes sense. I would propose to 
    ◦ Make ""*Featured Content*"" section smaller, maybe removing the row under the line to make it lighter on brain
    ◦ Find a way not to duplicate the latest contents on ""*Featured Content*"" section
• We have separated ""*Courses You Might Like*"" (top most, right after Reports) and ""*Articles You Might Like*"" (lower most) sections which breaks the onboarding flow. It might be better to put personalized contents in proximity (maybe under a group) for users to make sense of them.

1699355497.501769,Masoud Tahsiri,Campaign Monitor - Image Naming Conflict Resolution,"Hi <@U059AC59LLF>
In regards to the image issue. We have investigated the problem and have identified the cause of the incorrect image displayed on Campaign Monitor. The issue is related to images with the same name, which can lead to the system using a previously saved image rather than the intended one.
The two images in question are as follows:
1. Image on Campaign Monitor:
    ◦ Name: test-2.png
    ◦ URL: <https://i4.createsend1.com/ei/j/61/D7A/FCB/193625/csimport/test-2_3.png>
2. Image on WordPress:
    ◦ Name: test-2.png
    ◦ URL: <https://www.stackedmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/test-2.png>
To fix this issue and ensure that the correct images are displayed on Campaign Monitor, we will implement a solution that generates a unique name for every single image. This will prevent naming conflicts and ensure that the intended images are always displayed.
I think we should have this sorted out by tomorrow evening, myself or <@U039WK9NWA0>  will update  and send you the new template as soon as its fixed",refact-stackedmarketer,,Addressing the issue of incorrect images being displayed on Campaign Monitor due to naming conflicts with WordPress images.

1727805236.214259,Parnia,Learning Hub Updates - Design and Development Progress,"Hi <@U059AC59LLF>

We've reviewed your Q4 priorities and we can deliver the first 4 priorities within the 40 hours limit.
However, to give an estimate on the other more complex ones, we would require some time to dig deeper. Here is what I propose:
We can start working on:
• Learning Hub widget for ""Latest Tactics""
• Update navigation on learning hub
• Update user guide on learning hub
• Update general layout for learning hub (making it lighter on the user's brain)
And in parallel, we can also start a discovery task for one the following items:
• Job Board (good integration with social profile would be nice)
• Feed-based social profile / interaction module
• Add gamification so users gain points for certain actions
Upon your approval on the estimates after the discovery, you and <@U46P0EG4A> can start a contract expansion discussion if necessary.

Let me know what you think about this approach. We can definitely talk about an expansion now if you think it works better.

4. *Old Articles issue:* Good news! We've discovered an automated solution to address the duplicated image and extra tag issues within the ""News"" category. If all goes according to plan, we expect to have these matters resolved by the end of today.

1709819140.980249,Asghar,Staging Environment - Page Updates and Pre-Launch Testing,"Hi <@U059AC59LLF>

We inserted the GTM tag in the staging environment today. There are some updates and questions that have arisen as follows:

*Updates*
In our JavaScript file on the frontend, we have exactly implemented the same logic that exists in the following three tags:
• HTML: Storing Referrer into Session Storage
• HTML: Storing UTMs into Session Storage
• UTM Decorator v2
So, we save the referrer and UTMs in session storage (considering all aspects of how the referrer value affects the utm_source, etc.).
Then, we populate the hidden form fields (similar to the current production site), and we submit those field values to CM.
Therefore, in the new site, we will not need those three tags created in GTM, and those tags can be removed after launching the new site on production.

*Questions*
We were checking the production site to ensure in which forms UTMs and referrer should be set. In the current production site, for Free newsletter forms (SM, PoM, Tactics), both UTMs and referrer are sent to CM. On the pro landing page, there are four forms in which only UTMs are sent to CM, but not the referrer.
*_Question 1_:* I wanted to confirm whether the referrer in the pro landing page forms was missed intentionally or if we should send its data to CM.
_*Question 2*_: Another question regarding the production's checkout form. In the production's checkout form, at the moment, you are only sending the entered username to the custom field (Forum_Username) in CM. No UTMs/referrer are sent. Is this okay, or should we consider sending UTMs fields in this form to CM?

Now that GTM has been activated, we need to crawl through the different parts of the site to identify any cases where triggers are not firing properly. In certain instances, it may be necessary to create a new tag. It's important to note that prior to launching the new site, we won't be modifying any existing elements. Our current access permissions do not allow us to make any modifications, but we're grateful for any assistance in this matter.",refact-stackedmarketer,1709819140.980249,"Discussion about accessing the staging environment to test and update pages, ensuring readiness for the actual launch.",3d8cfd68-c5d5-4620-972c-27e277bb486b,U05SL9R85PF,2025-12-11T21:34:05.04Z

1707141219.761279,Abdurrahman,SM Pro - Information Architecture and Category Intersection Enhancement,"hey <@U059AC59LLF> quick question

Our dev team questions the ""Content Type"" & ""*Business Model*"" & ""*Topic*"" selectors on the Full Archive page, since the options under all are actually subcategories of the 'Pro' category. Their concern is

""Using one taxonomy for three selectors creates complexity. Imagine that the client creates a new category. How can we decide which selectors should show it?""

Now, there are two options in my head as a solution to this question:
1. Leave it as it is, if you add another subcategory in the future as a Content Type, Business Model or Topic, then there's a maintenance need to put that under the related dropdown within Archive page.
2. Let's create a new taxonomy structure where Pro category has 3 sub categories within which the related tags are organized. (This approach might need a migration but will futureproof tag structure and Archive dropdowns)
    a. Content Type 
        i. Report
        ii. Article
    b. Business Model

When updating to have headline or image within the ##Section it seems it doesn’t work to have normal text + image + normal text. It seems to be hard-coded to have headline + image, otherwise, adding an image after a paragraph breaks things.

My comment when requesting this was _“Is the structure of a section hard-coded that the image must be *only* after a heading? If so, we’d like to have the ability to include more than one heading or image with in a ##Section”_ and I now noticed in the sample doc that there’s only headline + image.

1702555631.972089,Abdurrahman,SM Pro - Onboarding Flow Design and Feedback,"<@U059AC59LLF> regarding the User Guide we proposed as part of the onboarding flow, our team has made research about tools for this task.

*None-Free solutions:*
In general, None-Free solutions offers some features that are not available in free ones, but those features may not be necessary for every product.

The main two advantages that they offer are:
• giving analytics for tracking the interaction of users during the tour (i.e which steps skipped, which dialog boxes ended the guide ,...)
• segmentation and creating different tours per user groups (this is also feasible via free tools but need some development time)
These none-free tools in their first tier have limitations of around 2,500 users per month. For the first tier they have different prices from $30 to $250 per month.
in the case that client wants to choose amongst theses non-free tools then we can give them a more detailed comparison.

*Free solutions:*
we have 3 options in this category:
1. *Simple Tour Guide WordPress plugin*: this is a useful tool for someone who wants to creates tours without any need to customization in dialog position, dialog events and etc.
2. *a11y-dialog*: as it describes it self, it is just a dialog window which follows w3 consortium’s modal pattern. it does not have any special features/methods which been developed for user onboarding
3. *introjs*: Due to its feature set, handy API, and rich documentation, Intro.js offers a wide range of customization options for creating guided tours, allowing developers to precisely handle the user experience. Its features include step-by-step guidance, highlighting specific elements, and easy integration into web pages. It maintains a good balance between being feature-rich while remaining relatively easy to implement. It’s also worth mentioning that using Intro.js for commercial purposes requires a license, with its lifetime license costing $10.
Our suggestion is using *<https://introjs.com/|introjs> ,* but we wanted your approval before moving fwd.

• GTM set up on staging
• Final QA
• Fix some issues on Mobile version on staging
• Complete AutoPub updates

Our friends have spotted an issue: Currently users can edit their e-mail adress on the <https://www.stackedmarketer.com/account/|Profile Page>.
However we think that e-mail should not be something that can be changed right away, due to the following reasons
• E-mail is the unique identifier of an account from business perspective
• Changing e-mail can cause potential issues in terms of consistency and functionality. An example is :
    ◦ When a user changes e-mail, the mail preference token created by Memberpress stays the same which causes problems on e-mails. 
RESULT: We suggest to make the e-mail field of the profile page NON EDITABLE. If an edge case happens where a user really needs to change their e-mail, they should just get in touch with support.

1749036843.774059,Parnia,Perfmatters and Gravity Forms Redirect Conflict,"Hey <@U059AC59LLF>

The team let me know they had to temporarily disable Perfmatters to fix <https://refactco.slack.com/archives/C0594LCK43H/p1748813691233639?thread_ts=1745238486.006899&amp;cid=C0594LCK43H|the issue> with Gravity Forms redirects.

The problem is that Perfmatters tries to optimize JavaScript, but the way it’s currently set up conflicts with how Gravity Forms handles redirects. Disabling it was the quickest way to get things working again. We do recommend turning it back on once the conflict is sorted out, since it helps with site performance.

There are two ways we can move forward:
1. *Tweak Perfmatters settings*: Instead of delaying all JavaScript, we can be more selective about which files to delay. It’s a more reliable long-term fix, but would take around 4–6 hours of dev and testing to make sure everything works smoothly.
2. *Stick with the current setup*: We keep delaying all JS and try to find the specific file(s) causing the issue to exclude them. It’s faster, but there’s a higher chance of running into similar problems later.
Since we're currently out of retainer hours, I wanted to check in and see if resolving this is something you’d like to prioritize this quarter.

*The bug:*

Uploading the wrong images. Today, we had this issue and it happens once in a while. This was the first time with the newest AutoPub version.

We’ve kept the CM drafts for reference here:

<https://cm.stackedmarketer.com/campaigns/13ba645044be2fe22540ef23f30feded/create>

<https://cm.stackedmarketer.com/campaigns/e13240bc708a6e272540ef23f30feded/create>

The doc that was used is this one: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/12g_-2HuFT9KvJtRgJujez5pk4KnOEQroFMnhZPgm31I/edit?usp=sharing>

Is there some caching that doesn’t update the images that get pulled or?

*Features:*

1. Ability to push a draft without the sponsor logo in the heading (Especially relevant for SM Pro and Tactics templates but we should have this ability on all templates)
2. Publishing PoM to WordPress, as one post. Title would be the subject line, then all sections would be pushed into that single post (FROM THE CREW, SPONSORED BY, PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT, and CLICKWORTHY).

Currently, it's active on all main forms, including SM, PoM, Tactics, and the Pro landing page forms. The rate limit is set to block a user after three attempts, meaning if a user submits a form three times, they won't be able to submit a fourth for the next seven days.
We want to ensure you understand how this functionality could affect form submissions and welcome any suggestions you might have to tailor it to your needs.

• Caching - when we update a page, it takes a rather long time for the caching to update so when we change content or a new image on a published post, it takes hours, maybe days, for users to get the new version. This caching also caused issues with logging into SM Pro, seeing reports with an active subscription (some people would see the paywall even though they had an active subscription). Clearing the cache on Cloudflare and *Breeze (within the WP dashboard)* seems to solve it for new visitors but it’s still not perfect. So, caching behavior is not creating a good user experience at the moment.

Hi Emanuel,

Thank you for reaching out.

To extend the trial period for an individual member, you can use the steps in our documentation here: Manually Extending User Access to Protected Content under the Manually Extending Automatically Recurring Subscriptions → Keeping Billings Intact section.

But since the transaction for the trial period is a hidden transaction (if the trial is free), you’ll need to add &amp;include-confirmations=true to the end of the URL after step 3 of the Editing the most recent transaction section. So, the full URL would look like this: <https://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=memberpress-trans&amp;subscription=123&amp;include-confirmations=true>. This will display the hidden transaction, so it can be edited.

I hope this helps.
